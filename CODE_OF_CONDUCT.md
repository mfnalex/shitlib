We will accept any pull requests if they meet the following requirements:

- It must still compile
- Ist must still work. It should also not break existing behaviour. ShitLib is supposed to be shity but still supposed to work just fine (even if it only barely works)
- The pull request description should not bother us with unnecessarry details. Instead of saying "optimized this or that method" it should just say "PERFORMANCE BOOSTS" or something like that.
- Comments should be either useless or non-existent. We don't want to waste time reading comments.
- Refrain from using plain old booleans. We got BetterBooleans for a reason. Use that instead!
- Do not remove existing features or you'll get rekd by mfnalex
- You can use Paper specific methods but you'll have to create a separate module for that
- DO NOT COMMIT your .idea folder. Although it's funny, it leads to problems whenever someone else wants to "contribute"
